        <h3>SMART ECG MONITORING SYSTEM :</h3><br>
        <mark>Summary:</mark> The last decade has witnessed an increasing number of deaths caused by chronic and cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs) in all countries across the world. CVDs are disorders affecting the blood vessels and the heart.
CVDs involving the blood vessels are known as vascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease. Those
involving the heart include heart failure, cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart diseases, stroke, heart attack, and
arrhythmias Smart ECG monitoring system using IOT and machine learning and artificial intelligence. In case
any abnormal condition occurs in a heart patient before seviour it will automatically send all the data related to
patient to nearby doctor and relatives and ambulance.<br>Smart ECG monitors, like those found in smartwatches or wearable patches, offer convenient and continuous heart rhythm monitoring, while traditional ECG monitors typically provide a more in-depth, but less continuous, analysis in a clinical setting.<br> Smart ECGs are generally single-lead, offering less comprehensive data than the 12-lead ECGs used in hospitals, but they excel at detecting atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. <br>Here's a more detailed comparison:
Smart ECG Monitors (Wearable Devices):
Convenience and Continuous Monitoring:
Smart ECGs are designed for easy use and can record heart activity continuously, allowing for long-term data collection.<br> 
Limited Accuracy:
Single-lead ECGs in smartwatches or wearable patches may not provide the same level of detail and accuracy as 12-lead ECGs.<br> 
Cost-Effectiveness:
Smart ECGs are often more affordable than traditional Holter monitors and can be a long-term investment due to their continuous monitoring capabilities. <br>
Integration with Digital Systems:
Smart ECG devices often integrate with smartphones and other digital platforms, facilitating data sharing and remote monitoring.<br> 
Traditional ECG Monitors (Clinical Setting):
Detailed Analysis:
12-lead ECGs offer a more comprehensive view of heart function, allowing for in-depth analysis of heart rhythms and other cardiac issues.<br> 
Limited Continuous Monitoring:
Traditional ECGs typically provide a snapshot of heart activity at a particular time and don't offer continuous monitoring like smart devices.<br> 
Cost and Accessibility:
Traditional ECG machines are typically more expensive and require a visit to a clinic or hospital.<br> 
Integration with EHR Systems:
Traditional ECG machines may have limitations in integrating with electronic health record systems. <br>

Frontend Trends in 2024 â€“ What Will Retain Your CustomerFront-end technologies are the tools and programming languages used to create the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website or application. They focus on what users see and interact with, like buttons, forms, and dynamic content, ensuring a smooth, engaging, and responsive experience. <br>
Key Front-End Technologies:<br>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
The foundational language for structuring web pages, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and images. <br>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Controls the visual presentation of web pages, including layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness across different devices.<br> 
JavaScript:
A programming language that adds interactivity and dynamism to websites, allowing for animations, data manipulation, and dynamic content updates. <br>
Front-End Frameworks:
Libraries that provide pre-built components and structures to streamline development, such as React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte.<br>
Other Technologies:
Include CSS preprocessors like Sass, build tools like Webpack, and tools for version control like Git.<br><hr>
<p>
    Backend technologies are the tools and frameworks used to build the server-side logic and data handling of web applications, ensuring they function correctly behind the scenes. They include programming languages like Python, Java, and Ruby, database systems like MySQL and MongoDB, and web frameworks like Django and Node.js.<br> 
Key Components of Backend Technologies:<br>
Programming Languages:
These are the building blocks for writing the server-side code, examples include Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, and PHP.<br> 
Databases:
Backend systems store and manage data using databases, which can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or non-relational (like MongoDB).<br> 
Web Servers:
These handle HTTP requests and deliver content to users, including Apache, Nginx, and IIS. <br>
Web Frameworks:
Frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js provide pre-built structures and functionalities for building backend applications.<br> 
Libraries:
Libraries like Mongoose, Socket.io, JDBC, and Pandas offer specific functionalities to enhance backend development.<br> 
APIs:
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different applications and systems to communicate and exchange data.<br>
